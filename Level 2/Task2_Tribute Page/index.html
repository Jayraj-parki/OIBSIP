                When Bhimrao Ambedkar was born to a poor Dalit father Ramji Maloji Sakpal and mother Bhimabai in a small Mhow village of Madhya Pradesh, nobody knew that he would grow up to be a great leader.  Every year, his birth date, 14th April 1891, is celebrated as Ambedkar Jayanti in India.  Though he hailed from a socially backward class and faced discrimination at every stage of his life, it never stopped him from becoming one of the greatest scholars of all time.  Moreover, his childhood was a series of struggles to fight prejudice for being Untouchables or Dalits.  His teachers and the other upper caste students would not allow Ambedkar to sit near them.  He was not allowed to touch the earthen pot to drink water.  Yet, he was not discouraged and continued to excel in academics.  After attaining his degree from the Elphinstone College, Bombay, he obtained his postgraduate degree from the London School of Economics.  He further continued his doctorate in political science and economics from the University of Columbia, USA. He was a social activist, economist, reformer, and politician.  He held the post of the first law minister of our Independent India.
                  In 1956, he became a Buddhist follower.  6th December is mourned as his death anniversary.  In 1990, he was conferred with Bharat Ratna for his contribution to India.
